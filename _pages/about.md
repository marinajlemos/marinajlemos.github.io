Welcome!  

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Economics at Columbia University with an interest in labor and public economics topics in the context of developing countries. 

Prior to Columbia, I received my B.A. and M.A. in Economics from Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV-EPGE) in 2016 and 2019, respectively. 

You can reach me at [mdl2178@columbia.edu](mailto:mdl2178@columbia.edu).
