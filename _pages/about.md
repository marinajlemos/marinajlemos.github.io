Welcome! I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Economics at Columbia University with an interest in labor and public economics topics in the context of developing countries. Prior to Columbia, I received my B.A. and M.A. in Economics in 2016 and 2019, respectively, at Fundacao Getulio Vargas - FGV/EPGE, Brazil.
